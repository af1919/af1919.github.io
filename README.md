Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## About Me

Hello! My name is Abel and I'm passionate about data analysis, programming, and continuous learning. I've been actively learning both SQL and Python for over a year now, and I'm excited to share my journey with you through this GitHub profile.

## Skills and Certifications

- Python: PCEP Recognized Python Programmer
- SQL: Proficient in SQL, including database querying and manipulation

## Professional Experience

My background includes 5 years of experience as a Purchasing Analyst, where I specialized in using SAP and MS Excel for data analysis and procurement processes. While my professional experience has primarily been in purchasing and procurement, I am currently focused on transitioning into a data analyst role. I'm actively working on enhancing my skills in data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling to make this transition successful by working on personal projects and receiving more accreditations.
